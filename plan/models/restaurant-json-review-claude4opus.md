# Restaurant JSON Review — Claude 4 Opus

## Overview

The list contains 14 phrases and 30 words. It covers a reasonable arc of a restaurant visit: arriving, seating, ordering, dietary needs, paying, and leaving. The words cover food items, flavors, utensils, and drinks. Overall it is solid, but there are notable gaps and a few candidates for removal.

## Suggested Additions

### Phrases

1. **"Excuse me!" — すみません (sumimasen)**
   Arguably the single most important phrase missing. In Japan you must call your server with すみません — they will not come check on you unprompted. This is essential for ordering, requesting items, or getting attention. Without it, a learner cannot bridge between "ready to order" and actually placing one.

2. **"What do you recommend?" — おすすめは何ですか？ (osusume wa nan desuka?)**
   Extremely practical when facing a menu you cannot fully read. One of the first things a tourist learns to ask.

3. **"Thank you for the meal" — ごちそうさまでした (gochisousama deshita)**
   Culturally significant phrase said after finishing a meal. Japanese diners say this to staff when leaving. It pairs with the existing "It was delicious" (おいしかったです) but carries a different social function — gratitude vs. compliment. Omitting it is a cultural gap.

4. **"Let's eat" / "I humbly receive" — いただきます (itadakimasu)**
   Said before eating. Together with ごちそうさまでした, these two bookend every meal in Japan. They are among the most culturally distinctive phrases a learner should know.

5. **"How long is the wait?" — どのくらい待ちますか？ (dono kurai machimasu ka?)**
   Practical follow-up to the existing "Please wait to be seated." Waiting in line is very common at popular restaurants in Japan.

6. **"For here or to go?" — 店内ですか、お持ち帰りですか？ (tennai desuka, omochikaeri desuka?)**
   Very commonly asked at casual eateries, fast food, and convenience stores. Japan's dining culture includes lots of takeout. This is a staff phrase the learner needs to understand.

7. **"One more, please" — もう一つください (mou hitotsu kudasai)**
   Simple, high-frequency phrase for requesting another item or refill.

### Words

1. **tea — お茶 (ocha)**
   A glaring omission. Tea is served free at almost every restaurant in Japan, often before you even order. It is more culturally central to Japanese dining than beer. The list has water and beer but not tea.

2. **soy sauce — 醤油 (shouyu)**
   A fundamental condiment. If the list includes wasabi-adjacent items like sashimi and sushi, soy sauce should be present.

3. **set meal — 定食 (teishoku)**
   One of the most common ways to order in Japan. Many restaurants are built entirely around the concept of 定食. A learner who doesn't know this word will be confused by many menus.

4. **large serving — 大盛り (oomori)**
   Very common option at ramen shops, gyuudon chains, and curry houses. It's a practical word that comes up constantly.

5. **hot — 熱い (atsui) / cold — 冷たい (tsumetai)**
   Useful flavor/temperature descriptors. The list has spicy, sweet, and salty but no temperature words — yet asking for a hot or cold drink is extremely common.

6. **gyoza (dumplings) — 餃子 (gyouza)**
   One of the most popular and iconic restaurant items in Japan, on par with ramen and sushi which are already listed.

7. **green tea — 緑茶 (ryokucha) or matcha — 抹茶 (matcha)**
   If お茶 is added as a general term, 抹茶 specifically is worth including given its global recognition and frequent appearance on Japanese menus (matcha desserts, matcha lattes, etc.).

## Suggested Deletions

1. **"Cash or card?" — 現金ですか、カードですか？ (jp-rest-cash-or-card)**
   This overlaps heavily with "Can I pay by card?" (jp-rest-pay-by-card). The learner's active need is asking about card payment. "Cash or card?" is a staff-side phrase that the learner can infer from context once they know 現金 and カード individually. Of all the staff-side phrases in the list, this one adds the least new vocabulary or comprehension value, since the immediately preceding phrase already teaches カード and 払えます. If the list needs trimming, this is the weakest link.

2. **"soup" — スープ (jp-rest-w-soup)**
   A minor candidate. スープ is a transparent loanword (English "soup" → スープ) that most learners will recognize without study. More importantly, the list already contains 味噌汁 (miso soup), which is the soup you'll actually encounter in Japanese restaurants. Generic スープ is more relevant to Western-style dining. That said, loanwords can still be worth listing for pronunciation practice, so this is a soft suggestion.

3. **"salad" — サラダ (jp-rest-w-salad)**
   Same reasoning as soup — サラダ is a transparent loanword. However, salad is common enough in Japanese restaurants (居酒屋 side dishes, set meals) that it earns its place slightly more than スープ does. Very soft deletion candidate.

## Other Observations

- **Perspective balance**: The list mixes learner phrases (things you say) and staff phrases (things you hear). This is good — comprehension matters. But the ratio leans toward what you say. Adding "For here or to go?" would help balance it further.
- **Pronunciation note**: The pronunciation for 味噌汁 is listed as "misoshiru" which is correct. However, 少々 is listed as "shoushou" — some romanization systems would write "shōshō." The list should stay consistent with one romanization style throughout (it currently uses the doubled-vowel style consistently, which is fine).
- **The "..." prefix**: The allergy phrase uses "...アレルギーがあります" with leading dots. This is a nice UX touch showing the blank is filled in, but the learner might benefit from a concrete example like "卵アレルギーがあります" (I have an egg allergy) since the component words (卵, allergy items) are already in the word list.
- **Missing drink**: No mention of coffee (コーヒー / koohii), which is very common in Japanese dining, especially at family restaurants (ファミレス) that offer drink bars.
