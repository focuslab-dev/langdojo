# Review of data/japanese/restaurant.json

## Deletions

1.  **"How many people?" (何名様ですか？)**
    *   **Reason**: This is a phrase spoken by the restaurant staff (waiter/waitress) to the customer. A learner using this app as a travel aid would *answer* this question (e.g., "Futari desu"), not ask it.

2.  **"Please wait to be seated" (少々お待ちください)**
    *   **Reason**: This is a staff phrase. While useful to understand, it is not something a traveler needs to practice saying in a restaurant context.

3.  **"Are you ready to order?" (ご注文はお決まりですか？)**
    *   **Reason**: Staff phrase. The learner needs phrases to *initiate* the order or call the staff.

4.  **"Cash or card?" (現金ですか、カードですか？)**
    *   **Reason**: Staff phrase. The learner has already asked "Can I pay by card?" or "Bill please".

## Additions

1.  **"Excuse me" (すみません - Sumimasen)**
    *   **Reason**: This is arguably the most important phrase in a Japanese restaurant. It is used to call the waiter to the table to order, ask for water, or get the bill. Silent waving is less effective; a clear "Sumimasen" is standard etiquette.

2.  **"Thank you for the meal" (ごちそうさまでした - Gochisousama deshita)**
    *   **Reason**: While "Oishikatta desu" (It was delicious) is included and good, "Gochisousama deshita" is the standard, culturally essential phrase said to the staff when paying or leaving the restaurant.

3.  **"What do you recommend?" (おすすめは何ですか？ - Osusume wa nan desu ka?)**
    *   **Reason**: Extremely useful for travelers who may not be able to read the full menu or want to try the house specialty.

4.  **"Where is the restroom?" (お手洗いはどこですか？ - Otearai wa doko desu ka?)**
    *   **Reason**: A universal necessity in any location, including restaurants.

5.  **"Separate checks, please" (別々でお願いします - Betsu-betsu de onegaishimasu)**
    *   **Reason**: Common scenario for groups of travelers.

## Modifications (Optional)

*   **"Salty" (しょっぱい -> 塩辛い)**: "Shoppai" is fine/casual, but "Shiokarai" is also common. "Shoppai" is acceptable, but worth noting. (No change strictly necessary here, just an observation).
